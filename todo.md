# Todo

- [x] Address homerow mod delays (probably with urob's fork). Right now they hang on to the layer too long.
- [ ] Update mouse key location
- [ ] Try layer-toggle (vs. manual layer - maybe just make a &lt to the same layer??)
- [ ] Create num/sym layers
- [ ] Rework util layers for TP settings, volume, media control
- [ ] Try different sensitivies on trackpoint
- [ ] Try combos
